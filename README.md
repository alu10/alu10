### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**alu10/alu10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
I am a student wanting to learn and at the moment I know a lot of HTML things along with CSS and some java, however I would like to start learning databases faster since I would like an amount to be able to take it to applied cases

### Where to find me?
